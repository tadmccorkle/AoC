# Advent of Code 2024

Add input data to `./input/day{XX}.txt` before executing any solutions.

- OCaml 🐫: [`./bin`](./bin)

  Produce solutions for a particular day by running the following from this directory:

  ```sh
  dune exec day<num>
  ```

  For example, `dune exec day01` produces solutions for day 1, `dune exec day10` for day 10, etc.

- Python 🐍: [`./py`](./py)

  Produce solutions for a given day by running the corresponding `day<num>.py`.
