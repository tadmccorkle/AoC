# Advent of Code 2023 with OCaml 🐫!

Produce solutions for a particular day by adding the input data set to `input/day{XX}.txt` and running the following from this directory:

```sh
dune exec day<num>
```

For example, `dune exec day01` produces solutions for day 1, `dune exec day10` for day 10, etc.
