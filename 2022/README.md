# Advent of Code 2022

Me taking a stab at AoC 2022 with Rust.

Produce solutions for a particular day by adding the input data set to `input/day{XX}.txt` and running the following from this directory:

```sh
cargo run --bin day<num>
```

For example, `cargo run --bin day01` produces solutions for day 1, `cargo run --bin day10` for day 10, etc.
